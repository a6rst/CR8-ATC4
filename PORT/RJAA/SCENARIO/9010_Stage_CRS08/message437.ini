[MESSAGE01]
The air surveillance radar and the ground radar can also be
switched with the space bar on the keyboard. By using keyboard shortcuts,
you can play the game more smoothly.

[MESSAGE02]
By clicking the section of the Ship table [DEL / GND / TWR / DEP / APP],
it is possible to mute the communications sounds of each section.
Also, mini strips and sections on the Ship table can be swapped and moved
using a mouse button long press-and-hold.

[MESSAGE03]
The taxiway that is color-coded by the ground radar is a high-speed
exclusive taxiway. You can decrease delays by using these taxiways for
aircraft that are delayed in arrival or departure. Also note that inter-spot
towing speed is different from normally taxiing aircraft.

[MESSAGE04]
Care must be taken, since aircraft in flight may encounter near misses
due to altitude paths crossing too close to each other even though the
routes are different. This will cause a "Game Over".

[MESSAGE05]
If you direct takeoff and landing aircraft at the same time on
a particular runway, this will cause the Danger index to rise.

[MESSAGE06]
If you instruct to takeoff with a tailwind of 4 knots or more, this will cause
the Danger index to rise. Also, landing under the same conditions not only raises
the Danger index but also will force abortion of the landing (Go-around will occur)
so ensure that you pay attention to wind direction and wind strength.

[MESSAGE07]
During daytime or nighttime, or during bad weather the arrival route may be
different even if the destination is the same. Since the arrival time is not
solely dependent on the approach route, let's issue instructions while referring
to the route shown on the flight radar and the attached Airport Guide.

[MESSAGE08]
The time limit varies from moment to moment depending on the type of aircraft
and the flight conditions. We must issue precise control instructions while
paying attention to the remaining time.

[MESSAGE09]
For departing aircraft, you can adjust the time limit and adjust the intervals
between aircraft by going to the runway entry point, changing the route,
releasing the altitude limit, etc.

[MESSAGE10]
For arriving aircraft, you can adjust the time limit and adjust the separation
from other aircraft, depending on runway changes, route changes,
runway leaving points, etc.
